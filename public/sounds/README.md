# Notification Sounds

This folder should contain audio files for notifications:

- `notification.wav` - Default notification sound
- `success.wav` - Success sound (optional)
- `error.wav` - Error sound (optional)

You can add your own audio files here or use the Web Audio API generated sounds that are already implemented.

For Capacitor mobile apps, these files will be used for local notifications.
